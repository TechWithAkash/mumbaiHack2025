# 🎯 USER GUIDE: Understanding Your AI Agents

## 💬 Simple Explanation

**Think of AI Agents as 3 smart assistants watching your money 24/7:**

1. **💰 Income Agent** = Your income coach
2. **🧠 Spending Agent** = Your spending watchdog
3. **🎯 Coach Agent** = Your financial advisor

They analyze YOUR real data and give YOU personalized advice.

```
🧠 Spending Agent
"Analyzed Food expense of ₹500.
Monthly Food total: ₹500"
```

💡 **Insight:**

```

The healthy range is 25-30%. Try to reduce by ₹1,000."

🎯 Coach Agent
"You're tracking well! Keep adding expenses daily
to get accurate insights."
```

**This is YOUR actual data, not fake numbers!**

---

### Example 3: When You Add Income

**You track income: ₹20,000**
**Your expenses: ₹6,500**

✅ **What Agent Shows:**

```
💰 Income Agent
"Recorded income of ₹20,000.
Analyzing income stability..."

💡 INSIGHT: "You're saving ₹13,500 this month (68%)!
This is excellent. You're in the top 5% of savers.
Keep it up!"

📊 Your Numbers:

🚨 **Alert You'll See:**

```
⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT
💰 Income Agent

"Budget alert: You're spending ₹3,000 MORE
than you're earning this month.

Your biggest expenses:
• Food: ₹6,000 (40%)
• Shopping: ₹5,000 (33%)
• Entertainment: ₹4,000 (27%)

ACTION: Cut Shopping or Entertainment to get
back on track."
```

## 🎯 What Makes Data "Make Sense"

### ❌ Bad (Generic) Advice:

- "Track your expenses" (But I already am!)
- "Save 20%" (20% of what? How?)
- "Budget better" (Too vague!)

### ✅ Good (Personalized) Advice:

- "Your Food spending: ₹3,000 (46% of ₹6,500)"
- "Save ₹13,500 = 68% of ₹20,000 income"
- "Cut Shopping by ₹1,000 to stay under budget"

**See the difference? Real numbers, clear actions!**
