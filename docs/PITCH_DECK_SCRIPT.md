# 🎤 Mumbai Hacks 2024 - Pitch Deck Outline

**WealthWise: Autonomous Financial Coach for Gig Workers**

---

## Slide 1: HOOK (15 seconds)

### Visual

- Split screen: Struggling gig worker vs. Happy user with WealthWise
- Large text: **"150 Million Indians Earn Daily, Struggle Monthly"**

### What to Say

> "Rajesh drives Uber 10 hours daily. Some months he earns ₹45,000, some months ₹25,000. One unexpected bill = financial crisis. Traditional budgeting apps assume fixed salary. They fail him. We built something better."

---

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

### Visual

```
❌ Traditional Fintech Apps Fail Because:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Assume Fixed Salary                     │
│ → 150M gig workers have variable income │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ English-Only + Complex UI               │
│ → Low financial literacy, prefer voice  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Require Bank Account Linking            │
│ → Privacy concerns, informal sector     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Reactive (Post-Spending Analysis)       │
│ → Need PROACTIVE coaching               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What to Say

> "Current solutions don't work for India's 150 million gig workers—Uber drivers, delivery partners, daily wage workers. They need an app that adapts to THEIR reality: variable income, low literacy, privacy concerns, and proactive guidance."

---

## Slide 3: OUR SOLUTION (30 seconds)

### Visual

```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🌊 Flex Budget Engine                   │

│ 🎤 Voice-First (Hindi/Hinglish)         │
│    "₹500 petrol bharwaya" → Tracked!   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔒 Privacy-First (No Bank Linking)      │
│    Manual + voice entry only            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🧠 Multi-Agent Autonomous System        │
│    Proactive alerts BEFORE overspending │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 📝 JUDGE Q&A PREPARATION

### Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you make money?**

> A: "Freemium model. Free for basic features. Premium at ₹99/month adds advanced analytics, unlimited goals, priority support. Also exploring B2B revenue with gig platforms who want to offer this as employee benefit."

**Q: What about competitors like Walnut, Money Manager?**

> A: "They're great for salaried employees. But they assume fixed income, don't have voice in Hindi/Hinglish, require bank linking. We're the ONLY solution built for variable income + informal sector. Different target audience entirely."

**Q: How accurate is your income prediction?**

> A: "Currently using statistical models (moving averages, seasonal patterns). 75-80% accuracy in beta. As we get more data, we'll implement ML models for 90%+ accuracy."

**Q: Privacy concerns with AI?**

> A: "All processing happens on our secure servers. We don't sell data. Users can export/delete anytime. No bank linking means we only know what users tell us—full transparency and control."

**Q: Can this work for salaried employees too?**

> A: "Absolutely! Our flex budget system works for ANYONE, but our unique value is for gig workers. We're starting with the underserved market where we have no competition."

**Q: How will you acquire users?**

> A: "Three channels: 1) Partnerships with Uber, Swiggy, Zomato (they want to support drivers) 2) Community marketing in driver/delivery groups 3) Word-of-mouth (gig workers trust peer recommendations)"

**Q: What tech stack?**

> A: "Next.js 15, MongoDB, Google Gemini AI, event-driven architecture. We chose this for speed—can scale to millions of users without rewrite."
