I'm thrilled to announce the launch of WealthWise - a privacy-first budgeting app built specifically for young Indian professionals! 🚀

After talking to 100+ users, I realized traditional budgeting apps have 3 major problems:
❌ Require bank account linking (privacy concerns)
❌ Don't understand Indian lifestyle (family expenses, festivals)
❌ Time-consuming manual entry

WealthWise solves all three:
✅ No bank access needed - your data stays private
✅ AI understands Mumbai rent, Delhi traffic, Bangalore costs
✅ Voice input in Hindi - "₹500 ka petrol bharwaya"

Features:
• 3-minute budget generation
• Voice expense tracking (Hindi/English)
• Smart goals with milestones
• Works offline (PWA)
• Free forever

Built for the next generation of financially savvy Indians 🇮🇳
