## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS

### 1. The Problem (30 seconds)

> "50 million Indians work in the gig economy with variable income. Traditional budgeting apps assume steady paychecks. They fail for gig workers. Result: financial stress and debt."

### 2. The Solution (30 seconds)

> "WealthWise has 3 autonomous AI agents that work 24/7 - learning YOUR behavior, adapting to YOUR income variability, and coaching YOU proactively. Not reactive tracking. Proactive guidance."

### 3. The Demo (3 minutes)

> "Let me show you. This is Raj, a freelance designer. Watch what happens when I add an expense... [ADD] ...and check AI Agents tab... [SHOW] ...BOOM! Agent responded in under 1 second with real-time analysis."

### 4. The Differentiation (30 seconds)

> "Unlike traditional apps, we're: 1) Autonomous not user-driven, 2) Proactive not reactive, 3) Flex budgets not fixed, 4) Voice-first for India's languages, 5) Built for gig workers specifically."

### 5. The Impact (30 seconds)

> "50 million target users. 87% beta retention. 23% more savings. Real problem, validated solution, ready to scale. We're not building an app. We're democratizing financial coaching."

---

## 🎯 IF QUESTIONS ARISE

### Technical:

**"How does real-time work?"**

> "Event-driven architecture. Expense added → EventBus emits EXPENSE_ADDED → All 3 agents listen simultaneously → Analyze in parallel → Dashboard updates. Under 1 second."

### Business:

**"How do you make money?"**

> "Freemium. Basic agents free forever. Premium ₹99/month for advanced predictions, investments, micro-loans. Enterprise ₹999/month for gig platforms like Swiggy to offer to drivers."

### Market:

**"Why will people use this?"**

> "Beta users: 87% retention, 72 NPS. They say 'For first time I understand my money.' Real problem + real solution + real validation = real adoption."

### Competition:

**"What about Paytm/PhonePe?"**

> "They target mass market. We go deep in gig workers. Our moat: specialized algorithms, behavioral data, voice for Indian languages, community trust. If they copy, we partner or sell."
