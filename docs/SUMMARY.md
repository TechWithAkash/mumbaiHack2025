## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes Your Solution Unique

**Other fintech apps:**

- ❌ Assume fixed salary
- ❌ English only
- ❌ Require bank linking
- ❌ Reactive analysis

**WealthWise:**

- ✅ Built for variable income
- ✅ Hindi/Hinglish voice
- ✅ Privacy-first (no bank)
- ✅ Proactive coaching

### The Secret Weapon: Multi-Agent System

You're not building a chatbot. You're building a team of AI agents:

```
🤖 Income Agent
   → Detects variability
   → Creates flex budgets
   → Predicts low-income periods

🧠 Spending Pattern Agent
   → Learns user behavior
   → Detects triggers
   → Intervenes proactively

🎯 Coach Agent
   → Context-aware advice
   → Personalized nudges
   → Goal-based coaching

📊 Orchestrator
   → Coordinates all agents
   → Makes unified decisions
   → Autonomous execution
```

**Judges will LOVE this architecture!**

         💡 Cook at home → Save ₹700"

JUDGE: 😮 "Wow! It stopped you BEFORE spending!"
YOU: "Exactly! Proactive, not reactive"
```

### Scene 3: Flex Budget (45s)

APP: Shows weekly income
     Week 1: ₹12,000 (High)
     Week 2: ₹8,000
     Week 3: ₹5,000 (Low)

     ✅ "Agent auto-adjusted budget 47 times
